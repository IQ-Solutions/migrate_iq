# IQ Migrate Module
This module is used to interface with Migrate Plus and import files from the Site Extractor.

In general, the migrate_iq module should only be edit for updates or additions to processing. In addition to the
existing migrate_plus process there is a IQ_XML source plugin that allows for data to be taken 
from the site extractor.

Usage should be fairly straight forward.

Please follow the example in migrate_iq_example
